CONTRIBUTING

Thank you for considering contributing to this distribution.  This file
contains instructions that will help you work with the source code.

The distribution is managed with Dist::Zilla.  This means than many of the
usual files you might expect are not in the repository, but are generated
at release time (e.g. Makefile.PL).

However, you can run tests directly using the 'prove' tool:

  $ prove -lr
  $ prove -lv t/some_test_file.t
  $ prove -lvr t/

In most cases, 'prove' is entirely sufficent for you to test any
patches you have.

You may need to satisfy some dependencies.  The easiest way to satisfy
dependencies is to install the last release -- this is available at
https://metacpan.org/release/WebAPI-DBIC

If you use cpanminus, you can do it without downloading the tarball first:

  $ cpanm --reinstall --installdeps --with-recommends WebAPI::DBIC

Dist::Zilla is a very powerful authoring tool, but requires a number of
author-specific plugins.  If you would like to use it for contributing,
install it from CPAN, then run one of the following commands, depending on
your CPAN client:

  $ cpan `dzil authordeps --missing`
  $ dzil authordeps --missing | cpanm

You should then also install any additional requirements not needed by the
dzil build but may be needed by tests or other development:

  # cpan `dzil listdeps --author --missing`
  $ dzil listdeps --author --missing | cpanm

You can also do this via cpanm directly:

  $ cpanm --reinstall --installdeps --with-develop --with-recommends WebAPI::DBIC

Once installed, here are some dzil commands you might try:

  $ dzil build
  $ dzil test
  $ dzil test --release
  $ dzil xtest
  $ dzil listdeps --json
  $ dzil build --notgz
